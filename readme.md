# ☀️ Ray Tracing Engine

A small-little ray tracing engine written in C++ and outputs images in .ppm format

## 📜 Features
- Creating ray traced images with proper lighting, reflectance, refractance, shadowing, and other details
- A counter to display the number of lines remaining in the rendering of the image
- A lot of math that is enough to hurt the brain

## 🕹️ Demo!

### 😸 Special thanks to:
https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io ...
this source allowed me to learn many concepts so that I could effectively write a functional engine

## 🛠️ Future Plans
- Need to fix something with refractance as the dielectric material seems to be buggy, as can be seen in the following image (the dark blue sphere)
